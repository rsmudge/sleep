Sleep is the Scripting Language for Enhancing Existing Programs.  Sleep is a small
scripting language with perl-like syntax implemented in Java.

<p>The attribute that makes Sleep different is it allows an application
developer to develop "bridges". A bridge is a very simple class that
implements a Function, Predicate, Loadable, or Operator interface (or any
combination thereof). Sleep is easily extendable to make an application's
features available to end-user scripters.</p>
